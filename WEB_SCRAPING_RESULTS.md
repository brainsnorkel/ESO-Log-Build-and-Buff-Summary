# ESO Logs Web Scraping Results

## Test Summary

We successfully created and tested a web scraping solution to extract ability IDs and action bar information from ESO Logs pages. Here are the key findings:

## Test URL
- **Report**: `7KAWyZwPCkaHfc8j`
- **Fight**: `17`
- **Source**: `1`
- **URL**: https://www.esologs.com/reports/7KAWyZwPCkaHfc8j?fight=17&type=summary&source=1

## Key Findings

### ✅ What We Successfully Scraped

1. **Page Structure**: Successfully accessed all ESO Logs page types (summary, casts, damage-done, healing, buffs, debuffs)
2. **JavaScript Data**: Found JavaScript variables containing game data:
   - `googleAnalyticsViewModel`
   - `talentTreeBlueprintCache`
   - Report metadata (report_id, zone_id, etc.)
3. **Page Elements**: Found ability-related UI elements and filters
4. **Content**: Retrieved full page content (116KB+ per page)

### ❌ What We Could NOT Extract

1. **Ability IDs**: No `data-ability-id` attributes found on any elements
2. **Action Bar Information**: No action bar or skill bar elements detected
3. **Direct Ability Data**: No ability names or IDs in accessible HTML attributes
4. **Player-Specific Data**: No player ability data in the static HTML

## Technical Analysis

### Why Action Bar Data Isn't Available

1. **Dynamic Content**: ESO Logs appears to load ability data dynamically via JavaScript/AJAX
2. **Client-Side Rendering**: The ability tables and data are likely rendered client-side after page load
3. **API Dependencies**: Ability data is probably loaded from internal APIs after the initial page load
4. **Authentication**: Some data may require user authentication or specific session tokens

### Evidence from Scraping

- **Static HTML**: Contains only UI framework and navigation elements
- **JavaScript**: Contains configuration data but not the actual ability/combat data
- **No Data Attributes**: No `data-ability-id`, `data-source-id`, or similar attributes found
- **Dynamic Loading**: References to `loadAbilitiesMenuIfNeeded()` suggest dynamic loading

## Recommendations

### 1. API-First Approach (Recommended)
Instead of web scraping, focus on improving the existing API-based approach:

```python
# Use the existing API methods that already work
abilities_data = await client.get_player_abilities(report_code, start_time, end_time)
cast_counts = await client.get_player_cast_counts(report_code, start_time, end_time)
```

### 2. Enhanced API Integration
The existing `get_player_abilities()` method in `api_client.py` already attempts to reconstruct action bar information from cast data. This is the most reliable approach.

### 3. Alternative Data Sources
Consider these alternatives:
- **ESO Logs API**: Continue using the official API (most reliable)
- **Game Client Integration**: Direct integration with ESO client (complex)
- **Community Databases**: LibSets and other community-maintained databases

## Files Created

1. **`src/eso_builds/web_scraper.py`** - Selenium-based web scraper (requires Chrome)
2. **`test_web_scraping.py`** - Selenium test script (failed due to Chrome requirement)
3. **`test_requests_scraping.py`** - Requests/BeautifulSoup test script (successful)
4. **Scraping Results**: Multiple JSON files with detailed scraping data

## Conclusion

**Web scraping ESO Logs for ability IDs and action bar data is not feasible** because:

1. The data is loaded dynamically via JavaScript
2. No ability IDs are present in the static HTML
3. Action bar information is not exposed in the DOM
4. The site likely uses authentication and session tokens for data access

**The existing API-based approach is the correct solution** and should be enhanced rather than replaced with web scraping.

## Next Steps

1. **Improve API Integration**: Enhance the existing `get_player_abilities()` method
2. **Better Heuristics**: Develop better algorithms for inferring action bar assignments
3. **Data Validation**: Add validation for ability data from the API
4. **Documentation**: Document the limitations and workarounds for action bar data
