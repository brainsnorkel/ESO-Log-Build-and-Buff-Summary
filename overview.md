This project is a python project toi use https://github.com/knowlen/esologs-python to access the esologs.com api.

For each trial, I want to take the five top scoring logged encounters for the current update, and build a report for each "boss encounter" of the class, and gear of the dps, tanks, and healers. 

The output will be something like:
